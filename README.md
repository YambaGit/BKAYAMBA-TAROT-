# BKAYAMBA-TAROT-

The tarot assignment was a cool outlet to show off my creativity within compsci which is a thing I wish I took more advantage of. I found the basics such as making the card array and selecting a random item from it to output pretty straight forward. My confidence sunk when it came to using outside files such as .h which required me to go for outside sources for help such as YouTube and tutoring. I decided to make the program output three random items from the list and classify them as “past” “present” and “future”. finally getting everything to work was extremely satisfying and made all the stress worthwhile. I wish I got this done earlier than I did but thank you again for giving me a chance to complete this, this was my favorite project this semester in terms of compsci.
